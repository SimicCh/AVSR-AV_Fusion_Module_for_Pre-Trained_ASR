This is the official repo for the paper [Self-Supervised Adaptive AV Fusion Module for Pre-Trained ASR Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13873).

# About
Our approach builds on a pre-trained ASR model (in this repo [Whisper OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/whisper)) and extends it with an upstream audio-visual fusion module to enable the ASR model to process multimodal inputs.
